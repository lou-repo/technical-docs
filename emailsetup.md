## How to Setup Purelymail Email

### I do own the email onyxmail.net but I am using a new email provider and additional configuration might be necessary. Go to `settings` >> `mail` >> `accounts`.


### Use the following email description - you can put any name too. It will show up on all your email messages.

### The following are the setup options after clicking next. You need to put the password for both the incoming and outgoing server.

### For mailbox behaviors double check that drafts, sent, trash, archive - and discarded messages line up --> choose `on server` not phone
