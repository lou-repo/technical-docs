# Human User Guide Project - @loujr

Hello welcome to my userguide. I borrowed much of these questions from a template as apart of helping those working with me to break the ice and to make collaboration with colleagues easier and faster. I like to write a lot of documentation and user guides but _as always_ writing about yourself is the hardest part. Thank you for taking the time to read my user guide and I look forward to working with you. 

## About me

Before GitHub I spent three years in the webhosting industry. My tech career is entirely self taught mixture of reading, on the job training, and trying things out on testing environments. I have a writing background in marketing and a linux technical support background. My goal is to eventually become a Software Engineer.


### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?

I am passionate and I capital "C" care about my job. I often tell myself that people don't approach their job with the same level of obsession that I do and for better or worse _I live to work_. I enjoy the grind and would say that I have inapproperiate work life balance. I am outspoken. This means I will tell you what is on my mind 100% of the time even if its something I am sure you are likely to not want to hear. I believe hard in advocacy especially for groups that are not able to represent themselves well. I will always cheer for an underdog. Despite being a loud high charged individual I prefer a quiet work environment with music in the background. 

	
### What drives you nuts?

When people are not flexible. Despite being rather quirky, I am always open to finding common ground and solutions to how to solve problems. Being in support, that is basically what I do 100% of my day is solving problems. Not being able to adapt to changing circumstances, especially if its not _cannot_ but rather someone is _unwilling_ to do so, really puts me in a bad head space. 

... but above all, I really really do not like being talked down to. That gets deep under my skin. 


### What are your quirks?

I fidget. I talk a lot. I like to use analogies. I am not afraid to push things for a new perspective and to seek out a different opinion not just if its someone I think will agree with me, but also if I think they will push back. I'd rather have someone I respect tell me _"this is not a direction you should go down"_ than be surrounded by yes men. Also, if I do talk too much or too loudly please just nicely lower your hand when I am in your line of sight. However, also realize that I am often loud because I am excited about the topic we are talking about and want to share the enthusiasm with you. 


### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?

- **loud** I have hearing loss, so part of it is I genuinely do not hear the volume of my voice or react to how loud I am becoming. The other part of it is when I get excited I get super loud. Me being loud is often me being passionate. 

- **confrontational** I have strong beliefs, I stick by my beliefs. I don't mind debating and defending my position. I can always separate the person from their ideas. I generally have a philosophy that just because I don't like your ideas does not mean you are a bad person.

- **can't read a room** I have autism. Some social queues I miss. I try to do my best to blend in and _act normal_ but I do have my awkward moments from time to time. I mean well but I am not always able to get the joke the first time around and it stings to be the butt of the joke. 

- **obsessive** I love my work. My philosophy is that its okay if you don't love it as much as I do. Just don't dump on me when I am trying. 

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
I really like caring and compassionate people who capital "C" care for their jobs. It doesn't have to be an obession like mine but just striving to improve is such a vibe for me. I like loyal people who tell me like it is without sugar coating. Another big thing for me is collaboration. I like to think we are all in this together and strive to provide the same experience for those around me.


### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?
I don't like people who are in my space and do not respect my boundaries. I don't mind joking around and there's few things that really sting but feeling excluded or isolated from a larger group is something that doesn't put me in a good headspace. If I find out that you have been dishonest, I will distance myself immediately. 

 
### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
I ask me how I am doing. Ask me what my thoughts on something are. I am more than happy to put together action items or process improvements. But really, just a little bit of kindness goes a long way. Seeing people genuinely enjoy the help I have provided them is something that really gives me the warm fuzzies. 


## About my interactions

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
Collaboration. I enjoy sitting down with people and walking in their shoes. I am very curious on _what makes you... you_ and thats how I coach people. Everyone has common ground you just need to find it. What works for you might not work for someone else but maybe together we can write a new chapter. I really enjoy naturally curious people who have an eye for details.
	
### What’s the best way to communicate with you?
You can slack me if its something small. If its something large I don't mind a zoom. However, if you are going to Zoom me just a quick couple words to put my mind at ease would help. _Hey Lou do you have a moment to discuss API ratelimits?_ works way better than _Hey can we hop on zoom for a moment_. 

 
### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
Start with the ask. Just get it right up front. If you are Slacking me and we have never talked before, don't begin with _"Hey lou how are you?"_. Just come out and say it. Also present a good arguement as to why this course of action is the best and why I should be involved. Also, if you really want to go the extra mile ... the steps and work you have done to reach this conclusion. 
  
### How do you like to give feedback?
I like to write good feedback. I don't mind writing a good review for someone and taking the time to list all the ways I think they have done a good job and hand that off to a superior. I also like telling people they have done a good job whether verbally or in writing. 


### How do you like to get feedback?
As quietly as possible, I just like to be acknowledged. A short cut to my heart is pulling me aside and saying. _"Lou I know how hard you are working. I see you did X Y Z and I wanted to thank you for doing a good job."_ And maybe a little good review come performance review time. I'll feel awkward about it and brush it off like its no big deal but it does mean the world to me whether I'll admit it or not.
