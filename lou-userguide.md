# Human User Guide Project - @loujr

Hello welcome to my userguide. I borrowed much of these questions from a template as apart of helping those working with me to break the ice and to make collaboration with colleagues easier and faster. I like to write a lot of documentation and user guides but _as always_ writing about yourself is the hardest part. Thank you for taking the time to read my user guide and I look forward to working with you. 

## About me

Before GitHub I spent three years in the webhosting industry. My tech career is entirely self taught mixture of reading, on the job training, and trying things out on testing environments. I have a writing background in marketing and a linux technical support background. My goal is to eventually become a Software Engineer.


### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?

I am passionate and I capital "C" care about my job. I often tell myself that people don't approach their job with the same level of obsession that I do and for better or worse _I live to work_. I enjoy the grind and would say that I have inapproperiate work life balance. I am outspoken. This means I will tell you what is on my mind 100% of the time even if its something I am sure you are likely to not want to hear. I believe hard in advocacy especially for groups that are not able to represent themselves well. I will always cheer for an underdog. Despite being a loud high charged individual I prefer a quiet work environment with music in the background. 

	
### What drives you nuts?

When people are not flexible. Despite being rather quirky, I am always open to finding common ground and solutions to how to solve problems. Being in support, that is basically what I do 100% of my day is solve problems. Not being able to adapt to changing circumstances especially if its not _cannot_ but rather someone is _unwilling_ to do so. Really puts me in a bad head space. 

... but above all, I really really do not like being talked down to. That gets deep under my skin. 


### What are your quirks?

I fidget. I talk a lot. I like to use analogies. I am not afraid to push things for a new perspective and to seek out a different opinion not just if its someone I think will agree with me, but also if I think they will push back. I'd rather have someone I respect tell me "this is not a direction you should go down" than be surrounded by yes men. Also, if I do talk too much or too loudly please just nicely lower your hand when I am in your line of sight. However, also realize that I am often loud because I am excited about the topic we are talking about and want to share the enthusiasm with you. 


### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?

- **loud** I have hearing loss, so part of it is I genuinely do not hear the volume of my voice or react to how loud I am becoming. The other part of it is when I get excited I get super loud. Me being loud is often me being passionate. 

- **confrontational** I have strong beliefs, I stick by my beliefs. I don't mind debating and defending my position. I can always separate the person from their ideas. I generally have a philosophy that just because I don't like your ideas does not mean you are a bad person.

- **can't read a room** I have autism. Some social queues I miss. I try to do my best to blend in and _act normal_ but I do have my awkward moments from time to time. I mean well but I am not always able to get the joke the first time around and it stings to be the butt of the joke. 

- **obsessive** I love my work. My philosophy is that its okay if you don't love it as much as I do. Just don't dump on me when I am trying. 

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
I really like caring and compassionate people who capital "C" care for their jobs. It doesn't have to be an obession like mine but just striving to improve is such a vibe for me. I like loyal people who tell me like it is without sugar coating. Another big thing for me is collaboration. I like to think we are all in this together and strive to provide the same experience for those around me.


### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?
I don't like people who are in my space and do not respect my boundaries. I don't mind joking around and there's few things that really sting but feeling excluded or isolated from a larger group is something that doesn't put me in a good headspace. If I find out that you have been dishonest, I will distance myself immeadiately. 

 
### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
I ask me how I am doing. Ask me what my thoughts on something are. I am more than happy to put together action items or process improvements. But really, just a little bit of kindness goes a long way. Seeing people genuinely enjoy the help I have provided them is something that really gives me the warm fuzzies.
